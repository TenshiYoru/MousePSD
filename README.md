# MousePSD
This engine was originally created by Lampy (https://lampysprites.itch.io/), who apparently has now no interest in giving support for their old projects.

As the engine was free, I am merely sharing the files to let other people use this software, so keep in mind I will in no way be able to help you fix any kind of bugs or work on the code.
But if you do have questions on how to use the engine I will try to help as much as I can, although instructions are included in the files.

I reserve the right to delete these files for any reason, especially if the creator asks me to, so be sure to grab your copy as soon as possible.
